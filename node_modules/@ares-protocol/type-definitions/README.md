## instruction

The package name is defined as `@ares-protocol/type-definitions`

The `@ares-protocol/type-definitions` exists on npmjs.com (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ares-protocol/type-definitions),
but is imcomplete and does not include all type definitions, so I decided to complete it with all the existing types and
include this package with the validator auto-payout

## usage

const types = require("@ares-protocol/type-definitions");
